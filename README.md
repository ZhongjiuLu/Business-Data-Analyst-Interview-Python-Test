# Business-Data-Analyst-Interview-Python-Test

A tech start-up data analyst python test

Requirements: 

- You have to answer the maximum number of question. You can use built-in function, except if you are told not to do so.

- The test is long, we do not expect you to answer all questions in 30 min (but we donâ€™t want you to be stuck neither). A complete answer to one question is better than half of the answer for two questions.
